These demos were built on this [portuguese course](https://reactavancado.com.br/) that I took.

__[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is the leading open-source headless CMS. Itâ€™s 100% Javascript, fully customizable and developer-first.__

Using Strapi is really super easy, since it's built on top of React. With just only one [command with yarn/npx](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/installation/cli.html#step-2-create-a-new-project) we can start a new project using this amazing headless CMS (we access its content using an API and it doesn't care about how and where its content gets displayed).~

__[Next.js](https://strapi.io/) gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.__
